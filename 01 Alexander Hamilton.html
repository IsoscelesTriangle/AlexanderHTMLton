<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">AARON BURR:</div>
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a<br />
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten<br />
Spot in the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in squalor<br />
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">JOHN LAURENS:</div>
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father<br />
Got a lot farther by workin' a lot harder<br />
By bein' a lot smarter<br />
By bein' a self-starter<br />
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">THOMAS JEFFERSON:</div>
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted<br />
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up<br />
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of<br />
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">JAMES MADISON:</div>
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned<br />
Our man saw his future drip, drippin' down the drain<br />
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain<br />
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">BURR:</div>
Well the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man!"<br />
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland<br />
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and<br />
The world's gonna know your name! What's your name, man?"<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">ALEXANDER HAMILTON:</div>
Alexander Hamilton<br />
My name is Alexander Hamilton<br />
And there's a million things I haven't done<br />
But just you wait, just you wait<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">ELIZA HAMILTON:</div>
When he was ten, his father split, full of it, debt-ridden<br />
Two years later, see Alex and his mother, bed-ridden<br />
Half-dead, sittin' in their own sick<br />
The scent thick<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">COMPANY:</div>
And Alex got better but his mother went quick<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">GEORGE WASHINGTON and (COMPANY):</div>
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide<br />
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, somethin' new inside<br />
A voice saying "(Alex) you gotta fend for yourself"<br />
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">BURR and (COMPANY):</div>
There would've been nothin' left to do<br />
For someone less astute<br />
He would've been dead or destitute<br />
Without a cent of restitution<br />
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord<br />
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and other things he can't afford<br />
(Scammin') for every book he can get his hands on<br />
(Plannin') for the future, see him now as he stands on (oooh)<br />
The bow of a ship headed for a new land<br />
In New York you can be a new man<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">COMPANY and (HAMILTON):</div>
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)<br />
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)<br />
In New York you can be a new man<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">WOMEN:</div>
In New York<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">MEN:</div>
New York<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">HAMILTON:</div>
Just you wait<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">COMPANY and (COMPANY):</div>
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)<br />
We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)<br />
You could never back down<br />
You never learned to take your time<br />
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)<br />
When America sings for you<br />
Will they know what you overcame?<br />
Will they know you rewrote the game?<br />
The world will never be the same, oh<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">BURR and (COMPANY):</div>
The ship is in the harbor now, see if you can spot him<br />
(Just you wait)<br />
Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom<br />
(Just you wait)<br />
His enemies destroyed his rep, America forgot him<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">MULLIGAN/MADISON AND LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON:</div>
We fought with him<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">LAURENS/PHILLIP:</div>
Me? I died for him<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">WASHINGTON:</div>
Me? I trusted him<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">ANGELICA SCHUYLER, ELIZA, MARIA REYNOLDS:</div>
Me? I loved him<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">BURR:</div>
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">COMPANY:</div>
There's a million things I haven't done<br />
But just you wait<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">BURR:</div>
What's your name, man?<br />
<br />
<div style="color: #ff6600;">HAMILTON &amp; COMPANY:</div>
Alexander Hamilton!</p>
